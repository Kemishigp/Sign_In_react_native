# Overview


I created an interactive sign in screen. It allows the user to input a password and a username in order to create an account. When the user inputs their password it doesn't the display the characters thus protecting the users information.

I created this app to help a user set up an account

# Development Environment

I used React Native environment tools within Visual Studio Code

React Native runs on Javascript and I used the libraries React Native has installed for text input displaying images and buttons

# Useful Websites
* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-S5a0eXPoc)

# Future Work
* Make a create account screen that lets the user set up an account
* Have the sign in screen take the user to the app once they provide their login info
